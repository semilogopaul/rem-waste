# Skip Hire Platform ðŸš›

A modern, user-centric skip hire platform built with React and TypeScript, featuring an engaging mascot-driven UX for increased user engagement. Click here to see how it is used in the live version: https://www.wewantwasteimproved.vercel.app

**I went the extra mile to read multiple articles in order to take a data-driven approach to the page revamp.**

'wewantwaste' is a catchy, memorable name, it's fun to say, almost playful. But 'waste' itself doesnâ€™t naturally evoke a positive or enjoyable feeling. Thatâ€™s exactly why, as a brand dealing with waste, we need to shift that perception. Weâ€™re not just managing waste, weâ€™re rebranding it. By pairing a bold name with engaging design, clear messaging and a playful mascot, we can make the experience feel approachable, modern, and even fun. This emotional shift is key to driving user engagement, retention, and long-term loyalty.

This research gave birth to trashy, our mascot and some other key features (trashy says hi btw)
